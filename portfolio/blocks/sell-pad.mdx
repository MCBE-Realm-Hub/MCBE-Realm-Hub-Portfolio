# Sell pad
Sell pads have been a popular concept in the realm community for a while. Whether it's for a Skyblock realm **or** Factions realm, it's always been an amazing feature to add! The basic concept of a sell pad is that whenever you stand on top of a block, the **sellable** items that are available in your inventory will be removed and in return you will be given score to an objective, which is usually **currencies** in the realm.

:::caution
This sell pad version uses a new beta command parameter called `haditem`. So, you will need to be on Minecraft Bedrock - Beta 1.18.20.21.

### Add your objective

:::note
Please make sure your default in game currency scoreboard is being used in this system.
:::

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/sell_pad/main.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```
scoreboard objectives add money dummy
scoreboard players add @a money 0
```

### Add "sell" tag to players standing on a beacon block
<CodeHeader>BP/functions/sell_pad/main.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```
scoreboard objectives add money dummy
scoreboard players add @a money 0

tag @a remove sell
execute @a ~~~ detect ~~-1~ beacon 0 tag @s add sell
```

### Execute an function if the player has "sell" tag and has dirt to sell from their inventory
<CodeHeader>BP/functions/sell_pad/main.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```
scoreboard objectives add money dummy
scoreboard players add @a money 0

tag @a remove sell
execute @a ~~~ detect ~~-1~ beacon 0 tag @s add sell

execute @p[tag=sell,hasitem={item=dirt}] ~~~ detect ~~-1~ beacon 0 function sell_pad/item/dirt
```

### Add an function file to give players score in an objective and clear item

:::note
Every item will need to have their own seperate function file.
:::

<CodeHeader>BP/functions/sell_pad/item/dirt.mcfunction</CodeHeader>

```
scoreboard players add @s money 1
clear @s dirt 0 1
```

# Multipliers

:::tip
You can make a system which lets you multiply the **score** you get from selling your items on the sell pad!
:::

### Add 4 objectives
* When a player sells items, it will increase this score, NOT the original scoreboard. Use this objective in sell shop or sell pad! 
  ```
  scoreboard objectives add MoneySell dummy
  ```
:::note
Please make sure your default in game currency scoreboard is being used in this system.
:::
* Your regular Money scoreboard. The objective you use as your games currency.
  ```
  scoreboard objectives add money dummy
  ```
* Your score multiplier
  ```
  scoreboard objectives add multiplier dummy
  ```
* Used to store values of the calculations
  ```
  scoreboard objectives add integer dummy
  ```

### How does multipliers work?
When you sell items it increases your score for objective "MoneySell", then it converts to money based on your multiplier!

## Integer multipliers
```
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s MoneySell *= @s multiplier
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s money += @s MoneySell
scoreboard players set @a MoneySell 0
```

### Display integer multipliers
```
tellraw @s {"rawtext":[{"text":"Your Multiplier: x"},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"multiplier"}}]}
```

## Decimal multipliers
These commands above will support multipliers in increments of 0.1. If you have a multiplier score of 24, then your actual multiplier is 2.4 because you are dividing your MoneySell score by 10.
```
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s MoneySell *= @s multiplier
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s money += @s MoneySell
scoreboard players set @a MoneySell 0
```

### Display decimal multipliers in increments of 0.1
```
scoreboard players set ten integer 10
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s multiplierWhole = @s multiplier
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s multiplierWhole /= ten integer
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s multiplierDecimal = @s multiplier
execute @a ~~~ scoreboard players operation @s multiplierDecimal %= ten integer
tellraw @s {"rawtext":[{"text":"Your Multiplier: x"},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"multiplierWhole"}},{"text":"."},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"multiplierDecimal"}}]}
```
